# COVID-19 Home Test Kit Delivery System

## Introduction
This Java program manages the delivery of COVID-19 home test kits (Lateral Flow Test kits) to vulnerable people in the community. It records the number of kits each volunteer delivers, calculates the monetary compensation each volunteer will receive, and generates statistical data about the total number of test kits delivered in a week.

## Requirements
- Java SE 11 or later

## Running the Program
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
3. Compile the source files.

Please ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.

## Known Issues
Currently, the software successfully builds and runs without any known issues. However, we welcome any bug reports or feature requests as we continually strive to improve the system.

## Observations and Thoughts
Creating a system to manage the delivery of COVID-19 home test kits has been a rewarding experience. This project has shown me the impact of software development in addressing real-world health issues. I've learnt a lot about Java programming and the development of robust solutions.

## Time Spent on the Project
I spent a few hours working on this project.
